# ðŸ§© vernacular ðŸ§©
Vernacular is a fun, web-based game that takes inspiration from wordle. In this early version, vernacular only supports five character words, but there are plans on changing this to support longer words in the future. The main difference between vernacular and wordle is that vernacular looks to support definitions of the words it makes the user guess. In doing this, I hope vernacular encourages more people to learn new words and expand their vocabulary while playing something fun!
