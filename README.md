# ðŸ§© Vernacular ðŸ§©
Vernacular is a fun, web-based game that takes inspiration from wordle. In this early version, vernacular only supports five character words, but there are plans on changing this to support longer words in the future. The main difference between vernacular and wordle is that vernacular looks to support definitions of the words it makes the user guess. In doing this, I hope vernacular encourages more people to learn new words and expand their vocabulary while playing something fun! 

# Goals
The goals I had for starting this project was recreating something I like a lot. In this case, it was Wordle! Obviously, I didn't want to just copy Wordle and not do anything else. Ideally, I would like to add some popup or something that tells you the definition of the word. Playing Wordle, there were many instances when I thought to myself, "I didn't even know this was a word". Vernacular aims to solve this problem!

# UI/UX
I wanted to play around with dark theme/dark mode logic. In my previous projects, I've not really thought about UI/UX and kept the background white which, retrospectively, was a pretty bad idea. I read some articles online that explained the dark theme process, and I tried to implement many of the key concepts and ideas I thought were most important into this site.

# Challenges
Because Wordle/Vernacular is unlike other standard sites (which are often static and just aim to display text), there were quite a few challenges that I ran into working on this project. Firstly, the design of the website forced me to learn flexbox which has been instrumental in simplifying this entire design process. The on-screen keyboard was a challenge as well since I had to allow it to input letters into the grids/tiles to form the words. This required eventListeners and a whole bunch of javascript logic that I had never worked with before. Finally, the game logic was also difficult as I had to determine correct behavior by just testing a bunch of stuff out on Wordle. Overall, I thought it was challenging, but I had a way better time tackling this project when I broke the project down into much more digestible and doable pieces. Vernacular also forced me to use javascript and interacting with the DOM more in the web-applications I've been building which is important practice for the future.

# Outcome
It took a lot of work, but I am satistfied with the final results of this project. It was really fun working with a lot more javascript! Overall, I learned a lot from this project, and it feels really good to be able to interact with what I created. Going into this project, I felt unsure as to whether or not I would be able to finish and implement everything I wanted to implement, but after some finesse, I was able to include everything I wanted and finish the game.
